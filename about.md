**Bio**

I am Zhou Qin, an algorithm engineer interested in graph neural networks, distributed systems, and functional programming. I graduated from Cornell University with a master's degree in computer science in May 2018, and then joined Alibaba Group, working with the commodity risk management team. Before that, I achieved my bachelor's degree (also major in computer science) in South China University of Technology. 

Personally, I'd like to do some in-depth research beneath a machine learning model (i.e. seeking mathematical explanations). As a member of editorial board for the open-source project [PumpkinBook](https://datawhalechina.github.io/pumpkin-book/#/), I am in charge of the content and quality of Chapter 8 to Chaper 16.

I am now mainly focusing on implementing large scale distributed graph nerual network frameworks, and applying graph neural networks on risk control scenario.
