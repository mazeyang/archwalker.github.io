**Bio**

I am Zhou Qin,  an algorithm engineer interested in graph neural networks, distributed systems, and functional programming. I graduated from Cornell university as a M.Eng in compute science student at May. 2018, and then joined Alibaba Group, working with commodity risk management team. Before that, I acheieved my B.Eng degree (also major in computer science) in Sourth China University of Technology. Cheek my [Resume](https://github.com/archwalker/archwalker.github.io/blob/master/_posts/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf) for details.

Personally, I'd like to do some in-deepth research beneath a machine learning model (i.e. seeking for mathematical explainations). I am now mainly focusing on applying graph neural networks into our commodity risk management bussiness scenario.
